#First Coding Project
##RPG roleplay console
THIS IS MY FIRST CODING PROJECT AND WILL ACT AS A PROGRESSIVE TESTAMENT OF GROWTH IN MY CODING JOURNEY. THIS PROJECT WAS COMPLETED ALONGSIDE THE FREECODECAMP PLATFORM. THIS PROJECT IS A SIMPLE RPG ROLEPLAY CONSOLE THAT ALLOWS PLAYERS TO PURCHASE WEAPONS, MONITOR HEALTH POINTS (HP), AND FIGHT THE GIVEN MONSTERS WITH THE TOOL AT THEIR DISPOSAL.
